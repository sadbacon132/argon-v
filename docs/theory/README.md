# ARGON-V Research Paper

This directory contains analytical and theoretical materials related to the
ARGON-V protocol.

`research-paper-v0.1.pdf` is a **v0.1 protocol and systems design draft** describing
the ARGON-V threat model, protocol stages, and security intuition.

The paper is **not an empirical security evaluation** and does not report
measured attack success rates or performance benchmarks. Quantitative models
and probability expressions are illustrative and analytical.

A working reference implementation exists but is not yet open-sourced.
Formal proofs and empirical validation are planned future work.
